# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository where I document my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository contains notes, code examples, problem-solving strategies, and resources that I find helpful as I progress in mastering DSA concepts.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Track my progress and understanding of various DSA topics.
- Provide a reference for myself and others who are learning DSA.
- Share solutions to common algorithmic problems.
- Explore different approaches and optimizations.

## Contents

- Explanations of fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Algorithm implementations (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, etc.)
- Problem-solving techniques and patterns.
- Practice problems and solutions.
- Resources and references for further learning.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse through the folders and files to find topics of interest. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
